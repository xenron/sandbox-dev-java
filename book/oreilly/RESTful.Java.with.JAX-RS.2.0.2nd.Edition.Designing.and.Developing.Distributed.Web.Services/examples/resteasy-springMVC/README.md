Spring and Resteasy
===================
Example of using RestEasy with:
- Spring
- Jetty (embedded)

System Requirements:
-------------------------
- Maven 2.0.9 or higher

Added client module. The module shows an example to test the existing war generated by the service module using the same
web container: jetty6 in an embedded mode. The container is injected in the junit 4 test. The client makes use of the resteasy client framework.

Building the project:
-------------------------

mvn clean install

Running the project and manually testing it:
-------------------------

mvn jetty:run

Open a browser at the following URL:

*NOTE*
-------------------------
This example as it is won't run in JBossAS, because Springframework 2.5.x does not work with JBoss VFS properly. 
To deploy this example under JBossAS, you should use JBoss Snowdrop (http://www.jboss.org/snowdrop) to integrate Springframework with JBossAS. 
The detailed description of the workaround can be found here: https://jira.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP-5051
