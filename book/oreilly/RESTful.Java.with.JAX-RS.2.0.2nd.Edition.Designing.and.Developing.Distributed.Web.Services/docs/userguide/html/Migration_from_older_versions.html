            Servlet 3.0 deployments within standalone Tomcat or Jetty can now use the Resteasy <code class="literal">ServletContainerInitializer</code>.
            This allows tighter integration with Resteasy much like you have within JBoss/Wildfly.  Check out the
            installation/configuration section of this document for more information.

            Form parameters are now read via a provider where earlier they were read from HttpServletRequest.getParameterMap().
            This may break deployments that depend on that behavior, i.e. if you have a servlet filter that calls that very method.
            For those situations I added the switch resteasy.use.container.form.params
        </li><li>
            The JAX-RS TCK has become very strict with a ton more tests.  I can't remember them all, but there are a number
            of edge cases which earlier Resteasy releases misinterpreted.
        </li><li>
            Any Failure exceptions in the SPI now have a corresponding JAX-RS 2.0 exception, so they have been deprecated
            Resteasy no longer uses these old SPI exceptions internally.  It now uses the JAX-RS 2.0 ones.
        </li><li>
            A number of SPIs have changed.  Shouldn't be an issue for those of you who use Restasy as-is.  Specifically
            InjectorFactory and Registry have changed.

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li>
            The JAX-RS 2.0 TCK has become very very strict in terms of the matching algorithm.  Unfortunately, the matching
            algorithm is quite poor so there are a number of resource schemes that will no longer match.
            For example, resource classes are scanned for a best match, other are ignored in the match.
            Resource locators are not visited unless they are a best match over resource methods.  There is one config switch
            I added so that Resteasy will ignore the Spec defined class expression filtering step and instead match
            base on the full expressions of each JAX-RS method.  resteasy.wider.request.matching.  Set that to true
            and you will at least be able to avoid that.

            The JAX-RS 2.0 class ClientFactory no longer exists.  It has been replaced with ClientBuilder.  You can
            still call newClient(), but there is now an additional builder interface.  Likewise, there is no
            ResteasyClientFactory.  We also have an extension to ClientBuilder called ResteasyClientBuilder.  So docs
            for more details.
        </li><li>
            Filter execution and exception handling now matches the JAX-RS 2.0 spec.  Exceptions thrown from filters/interceptors

            The constructors for ResteasyClient class are no longer public.  You need to use the new ResteasyClientBuilder
            class.  One thing to note is that when a ResteasyClient is created by a builder, it no longer
            uses ResteasyProviderFactory.getInstance(), but instead instantiates a new one.  This will probably
            not effect most uses.

            Resteasy manual client API, interceptors, StringConverters, StringParamterConverters, and Async HTTP APIs have all been
            deprecated and will be removed possibly in a later release.  There is now a JAX-RS 2.0 equivalent for each
            of these things.
        </li><li>
            resteasy-crypto: SignedInput and SignedOutput must have a multipart/signed content type set either through
            the request or response object, or by annotation @Consumes/@Produces
        </li><li>
            Server-side cache setup has been changed. Please see documentation for more details.
        </li><li>
            The security filters for @RolesAllowed, etc. now return 403, Forbidden instead of 401.
        </li><li>
            Most add() methods have been removed or made protected in ResteasyProviderFactory.  Use registerProvider() and registerProviderInstance() methods.
        </li><li>
            The new JAX-RS 2.0 client-side filters will not be bound and run when you are using Resteasy's old client api.
        </li><li>
            On server-side, all old Resteasy interceptors can run in parallel with the new JAX-RS 2.0 filter and interceptor
            interfaces.
        </li><li>
            Some SPIs have changed.  This should not effect applications unless you are doing something you aren't supposed
            to do.
        </li><li>
            The async tomcat and async jboss web modules have been removed.  If you are not running under Servlet 3.0,
            async HTTP server-side, will be faked and run synchronously in same request thread.

            MultipartInput has a new close() method.  If you have a read body that is MultipartInput or one of
            its subinterfaces, then you must call this method to clean up any temporary files created.  Otherwise,
            these possible temporary files are deleted on GC or JDK shutdown.  Other multipart providers clean up

            Apache Http Client 4.x is now the default underlying client HTTP mechanism.  If there are problems, you
            can change the default mechanism by calling ClientRequest.setDefaultExecutorClass.

            ClientRequest no longer supports a shared default executor.  The

          Form parameter processing behavior was modified because of RESTEASY-574.  If you are having problems with form paramater processing on Tomcat after
          this fix, please log a JIRA or contact the resteasy-developers email list.
        </li><li>
	  Some subtle changes were made to ExceptionMapper handling so that you can write ExceptionMappers for any exception thrown internally or within
	  your application.  See JIRA Issue RESTEASY-595 for more details.  This may have an effect on existing applications that have an ExceptionMapper
	  for RuntimeException in that you will start to see Resteasy internal exceptions being caught by this kind of ExceptionMapper.
        </li><li>
            The resteasy-cache (Server-side cache) will now invalidate the cache when a PUT, POST, or DELETE is done on a particular URI.

                There is a new Filter implementation that is the preferred deployment mechanism. Servlet-based
                deployments are still supported, but it is suggested you use to using a FilterDispatcher. See

                As per required by the spec List or array injection of empty values will return an empty collection
                or array, not null. I.e.
                (@QueryParam("name") List&lt;String&gt; param) param will be an empty List. Resteasy 1.2.x and
                earlier would return null.

                We have forked TJWS, the servlet container used for embedded testing into the group
                org.jboss.resteasy, with the artifact id of tjws. You will need
                to remove these dependencies from your maven builds if you are using any part of the resteasy
                embeddable server. TJWS has a number of startup/shutdown

                Client Executor and pass it in as a parameter if you want to re-use existing Apache HttpClient
                sessions or do any special configuration. The same is true for the ProxyFactoyr methods.
            </li><li>
                Apache HttpClient 4.0 support is available if you want to use it. I've had some trouble with it so

                It is no longer required to call RegisterBuiltin.register() to initialize the set of providers. Too
                many users forgot to do this (include myself!). You can turn this off by calling the static method
