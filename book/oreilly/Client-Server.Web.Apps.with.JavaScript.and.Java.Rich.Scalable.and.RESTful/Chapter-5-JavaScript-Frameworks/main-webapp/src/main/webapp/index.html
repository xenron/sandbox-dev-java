			<p>Minimal, responsive framework 
				created to capture a variety of best practices that make web sites
				fast, robust, and adaptable.  It incorporates features 
				relevant to mobile device design.  It includes
				 minified versions of jQuery (through Google's Content Delivery Network - along with local fallback) 
				, Modernizr which provides browser feature detection and normailze.css.
				It is designed to gracefully degrade even with old browsers (such as preventing failures
				on old versions of IE that did not implement console.log).  It also includes
				server side configuration (Apache settings) to optimize performance.
				</p>

				running JavaScript tests.
