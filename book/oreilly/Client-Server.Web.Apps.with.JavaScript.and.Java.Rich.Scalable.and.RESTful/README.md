Client Server Web Applications

Several applications demonstrating a "client-server" model of web development.  

Rather than the server-oriented approaches traditionally used in the Java community,
these applications use JavaScript frameworks which make REST calls and communicate
using JSON as the data interchange format.

These are small, proof-of-concept prototypes intended to demonstrate basic 
design, structure and operation using various languages, libraries and frameworks.  They
are not full-fledged, bullet proof, enterprise grade applications.  These details are
left as an exercise to the reader :).
