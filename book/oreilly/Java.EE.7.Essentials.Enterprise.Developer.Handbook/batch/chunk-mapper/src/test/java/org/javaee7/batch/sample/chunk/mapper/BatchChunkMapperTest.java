/**
 * The Batch specification provides a Chunk Oriented processing style. This style is defined by enclosing into a
 * transaction a set of reads, process and write operations via +javax.batch.api.chunk.ItemReader+,
 * +javax.batch.api.chunk.ItemProcessor+ and +javax.batch.api.chunk.ItemWriter+. Items are read one at a time, processed
 * and aggregated. The transaction is then committed when the defined +checkpoint-policy+ is triggered.
 *
 * Many batch processing problems can be solved with single threaded, single process jobs, but the Batch specification
 * allows for steps to be executed as a partitioned step, meaning that the step can be parallelized across multiple
 * threads. This is useful if you have some kind of bottleneck or if you can considerable boost your batch processing
 * performance by splitting the work to be done.
 *
 * You can define the number of partitions and the number of threads using a custom mapper. The custom mapper needs to
 * implement +javax.batch.api.partition.PartitionMapper+ and create a new +javax.batch.api.partition.PartitionPlan+ to
 * define the partitions behaviour. Each partition is required to receive a set of unique parameters that instruct it
 * into which data it should operate.
 *
 * Since each thread runs a separate copy of the step, chunking and checkpointing occur independently on each thread for
 * chunk type steps.
 *
 * include::myJob.xml[]
 *
 * A job is defined in the +myJob.xml+ file. Just a single step with a reader, a processor and a writer. This step also
 * defines that the step should be executed into a partition with a custom mapper:
 *
 * include::MyMapper[]
 *
 * The mapper defines 2 partitions and 2 threads. Properties for each partition define the data that is going to be
 * read. For the first partition we start on 1 and end on 10. For the second partition we start on 11 and end on 20. The
 * +MyItemReader+ will generate the data based on these properties.
 *
 * include::MyItemReader[]
