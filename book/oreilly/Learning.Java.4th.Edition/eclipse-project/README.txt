This directory contains two identical copies of the full Learning Java source code, packaged for eclipse in different ways.  If you are following the instructions in Chapter 2 please choose the "examples-eclipse-ch2.zip" file.  If you are following the instructions in Appendix A please choose "examples-eclipse-appa.zip".

The difference is that the Appendix A version contains a top level "Learning Java" folder and the Chapter 2 version has the contents at the top level of the zip file.  We apologize for the necessity of the two versions; the loading instructions in each chapter are slightly different and will be reconciled in a future update.
