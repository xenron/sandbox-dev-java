Example Code for Java in a Nutshell (6th Edition)

This is the example programs and samples from Java in a Nutshell (6th Edition) 
written by Ben Evans and published by O'Reilly.

The initial code drop is incomplete - rather than spending a lot of time tidying
up the code from how it was actually written (& in several cases, the code
examples dated back to an older version of the text and have to be manually
extracted from the book text), I felt it better to get something out there and
in use, and add to it a bit at a time.

If you have specific requests, or suggestions for improvement, or possible
examples you'd like to see, please leave a Github issue. Pull requests are
also very welcome, but please ensure that they are formatted to Netbeans
default Java style before sending.

Special thanks to James Gough for his contributions to the Ch09 examples, and to
the other members of the London JSR 310 project team for making this API happen
in time for JDK 8.

Thanks,

-Ben (@kittylyst)
