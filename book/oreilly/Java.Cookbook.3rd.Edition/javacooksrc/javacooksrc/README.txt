This is a static snapshot of the code samples for the Java Cookbook, 3rd Edition.

It was prepared by selecting files from several other repositories:

http://github.com/IanDarwin/javasrc - the main part;
http://github.com/IanDarwin/darwinsys-api - the "reusable API" parts;
http://github.com/IanDarwin/javasrcee - Java Enterprise stuff, only a few examples.

If you want to get updates to these files on a regular basis, you should
'git clone' those repos and 'git pull' periodcally.

Thanks for reading the Java Cookbook!
