How to use this example 
-------------------------
- Extract the zip file to your local file system. You may see **rest-appendix-odata** folder in the extracted location.
- This is a maven parent project and it has four sub projects
    - <rest-appendix-odata-service> : This project demonstrates how to generate OData services for your JPA model. This feature is enabled via Apache Olingo.  To learn about this project, refer (rest-appendix-odata-service/README.txt)   
    - <rest-appendix-client> : This project demonstrates how to consume OData services from a Java client. This feature is enabled via Apache Olingo. To learn about this project, refer (rest-appendix-odata-client/README.txt) 
      
- Open the rest-appendix-odata project in NetBeans IDE 8.0.2 or higher

    - In main tool bar,choose File > Open Project > rest-appendix-odata
    - In the project pane, expand rest-appendix-odata project and double click desired project to open in the IDE
    - **You will find a README.txt file under each project listed below rest-appendix-odata. Please go through this file to know how to run the respective project.**
