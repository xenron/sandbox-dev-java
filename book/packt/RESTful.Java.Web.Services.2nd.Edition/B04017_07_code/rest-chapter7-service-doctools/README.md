Detailed instructions for setting up all the required tools for running the 
examples used in this book are discussed in Appendix section of this book

Before you begin
----------------
- If you are not familiar with NetBeans IDE and GlassFish, move back and refer to the section 'Building your first RESTful web service with JAX-RS' in Chapter 3 of this book. Please follow the detailed steps that you will find in this section and complete the sample application before trying out any other examples. This will make sure your IDE and GlassFish Server is configured properly to run all the examples given in this book.
 
How to use this example 
-------------------------
- Extract the zip file to your local file system. You may see **rest-chapter7-service-doctools** folder in the extracted location.
- This is a maven parent project and it has four sub projects
    - <rest-chapter7-jaxrs2wadl> : This project demonstrates how to generate WADL api documentation file from JAX-RS resource class.  To learn about this project, refer (rest-chapter7-jaxrs2wadl/README.md)   
    - <rest-chapter7-jaxrs2raml> : This project demonstrates how to generate RAML api documentation file from JAX-RS resource class. To learn about this project, refer (rest-chapter7-jaxrs2raml/README.md)      
    - <rest-chapter7-raml2jaxrs> : This project demonstrates how to generate JAX-RS resource class(templates) from a RAML api doc file. To learn about this project, refer (rest-chapter7-raml2jaxrs/README.md)       
    - <rest-chapter7-jaxrs2swagger> : This project demonstrates how to generate Swagger api documentation from JAX-RS resource class.  To learn about this project, refer (rest-chapter7-jaxrs2swagger/README.md)  
      
- Open the rest-chapter7-service-doctools project in NetBeans IDE 8.0.2 or higher

    - In main tool bar,choose File > Open Project > rest-chapter7-service-doctools
    - In the project pane, expand rest-chapter7-service-doctools project and double click desired project(located inside the 'Modules' element ) to open in the IDE
    - **You will find a README.md file under each project listed below rest-chapter7-service-doctools. Please go through this file to know how to run the respective project.**    


What next?
----------------------------
This project will help you to get a real feel of various api documentation tools that you learned in chapter 7. You can explore each tool  at your own pace. Also try enhancing the samples by adding more features that you find interesting, even you can try out API doc tools that are not listed here as well(in fact there are many such tools available today)  !
