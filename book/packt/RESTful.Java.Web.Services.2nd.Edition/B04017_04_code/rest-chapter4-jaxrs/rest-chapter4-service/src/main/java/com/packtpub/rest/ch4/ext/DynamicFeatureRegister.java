/**
 * A JAX-RS meta-provider for dynamic registration of post-matching providers
 * during a JAX-RS application setup at deployment time. Dynamic feature is used
 * by JAX-RS runtime to register providers that shall be applied to a particular
 * resource class and method and overrides any annotation-based binding
 * definitions defined on any registered resource filter or interceptor
 * instance. Providers implementing this interface MAY be annotated with
 * @Provider annotation in order to be discovered by JAX-RS runtime when
 * scanning for resources and providers. This provider types is supported only
 * as part of the Server API.
