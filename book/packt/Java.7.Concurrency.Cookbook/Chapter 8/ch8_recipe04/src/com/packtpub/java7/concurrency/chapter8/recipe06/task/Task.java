 * This class implements a task used to show how to monitor the

 * is increment all the elements of an array. Every task has to
 * process a set of elements of this array. If the task has to process
 * more than 100 elements, it divides the set it has two process in two
 * subsets and create two tasks to execute them. Otherwise, it process
 * the elements of the subset it has to process
