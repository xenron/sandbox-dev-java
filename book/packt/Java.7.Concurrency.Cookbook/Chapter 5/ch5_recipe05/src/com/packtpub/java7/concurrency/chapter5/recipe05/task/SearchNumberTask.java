 * This task look for a number in an array of integer numbers.
 * If the part of the array it has to process has more than
 * 10 elements, it creates two subtasks and executes then asynchronously
 * with the fork method. Otherwise, look for the number in the block
 * it has to process.
 * 
 * If the task found the number, return the position where the number has
 * been found. Else, return the -1 value. If a subtask found the number,
 * the tasks suspend the other subtask and return the position where the number
 * has been found. If none of the two subtasks found the number, return the -1
 * value.
