I'm smellin' like the rose that somebody gave me on my birthday deathbed,
I'm smellin' like the rose that somebody gave me 'cause I'm dead & bloated.
The more you cry your ashes turn to mud!
One of these days i'm going to cut you into little pieces! And I've got this friend, you see. Who makes me feel and.
Will you come with me?
Become your own fear...
RX damn your righteous hand
